title: Migrating from v2
---

In v3 we have added many changes and performance updates which help your code look and feel better. But before we hop
in, let's see the breaking changes.

## Breaking changes

In v3 we have removed all methods such as `getBrawlers` and `getRotation`, etc from the client so as a replacement we
have adopted managers system, so here is how your code should change:

```diff
- await client.getBrawlers()
+ client.brawlers
- await client.getRotation()
+ await client.rotation.get()
- await client.getPlayer()
+ await client.players.fetch()
- await client.getClub()
+ await client.clubs.fetch()
```

## New Features

As stated in the above [section](#breaking-changes) we have added managers, here are some advantages of them:

- They have cache implemented inside them reducing your data call time.
- Some have an additional method called `fetchMany` which allows you to fetch multiple players/clubs at once.
- We have added leaderboards :tada:, you can use them via `client.leaderboards`.
- We now export more types for typescript users.
- We now also have a `BattlelogManager` which can be accessed via `client.battlelogs`.
- `client.brawlers` is no longer async :tada:.
